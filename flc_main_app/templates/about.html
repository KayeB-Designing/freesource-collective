                                <p style="font-size: 16px; color:#02425d">I was lucky enough to do an informational interview with Steve Cashdollar, author of the book Simple Courage, and he helped me gain a better insight of how I could help others. I was introduced to his book and his work through someone that was able to recieve his life coaching through some of his volunteer work. I knew he had a long history of working with people who have nothing, who are coming from bad situations, people that don't even know what help they need or how to get it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="font-size: 16px; color:#02425d">I've always had a passion for helping others, and I've always had a passion for making things. Figuring out how to combine those into my own unique brand of software developement and ultimately creating a business where I make things that help people. I asked Steve, "What are the biggest things that hold people back that could be relieved through thoughtful automation?" and gave the example of an app that could give medication reminders. Steve thought about my question for a moment then gave me an answer that changed my outlook on life.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="font-size: 16px; color:#02425d">He told me "The biggest thing holding back the people I've worked with is not knowing how to live.", and explained that people have such diverse backgrounds but many people enter adulthood never having been taught about or how to do so many crucial things including basic life skills. He told me to pick one way I love to help people, some niche that I really love, and figure out within that what I can automate.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="font-size: 16px; color:#02425d">The Freesource Library was my first project that allowed me to use my software engineering skills and my professional researching skills to create an application that put valuable resources directly into the hands to the user without the stress of any financial burden. The Freesource Library Collective has the same core values but with expanded functionality. Users can now create an account and contribute resources to the collective as well as create personalized lists of resources that are most valuable to them.</p>
